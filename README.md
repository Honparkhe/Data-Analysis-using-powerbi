# Sales Store Dashboard
A Power BI Sales Store Dashboard Project is designed to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance across one or multiple store locations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. This project involves gathering, cleaning, and visualizing sales data to identify trends, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and assess overall store performance.
